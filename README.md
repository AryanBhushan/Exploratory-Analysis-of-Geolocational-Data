# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Geolocational-Data
## Project Description
```
Experience a day in the life of a Data Scientist/Engineer by doing a full-fledged analysis of
real-life data. Fetch, Clean, Analyse and run K Means Clustering on Geolocational data to
recommend accommodations to immigrants to a city!
```
## Objective
```
This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for
students in Bangalore (or any other city of your choice) by classifying accommodation for
incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to
the location.
```
## Project Context
```
Implementing the project will take you through the daily life of a data science engineer -
from data preparation on real-life datasets, to visualising the data and running machine
learning algorithms, to presenting the results.
In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It’s a
frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course,
even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good
meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly
understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect
of the lifestyle one leads.
Now, imagine a scenario where a person has newly moved into a new location. They already
have certain preferences, certain tastes. It would save both the student and the food
providers a lot of hassle if the student lived close to their preferred outlets. Convenience
means better sales, and saved time for the customer.
Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this
information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of
his current customers, they’d ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is
at its highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more
customers served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide
variety of tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to
their liking.
